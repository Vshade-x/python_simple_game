# PYTHON PYGAME | SPACE INVADERS (OOP REFRACTOR)

### 🎯 Project Overview

A classic arcade game implementation developed using Python's Pygame library. This project serves as a clear demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles applied to real-time game logic, collision detection, and entity management.

### ✨ Key Features & Technical Details

* **Object-Oriented Design (OOP):** The game architecture is structured using custom classes for essential entities, including **Player**, **Enemy**, and **Bullet**, demonstrating clean and modular code design.
* **Game Loop and Event Handling:** Implementation of a robust main game loop to handle continuous rendering, user input (keyboard controls), and state management (Game Over/Score).
* **Collision Detection:** Uses mathematical functions (Pygame & Math) for accurate hit detection between game entities.
* **Resource Management:** Handles the loading and playback of audio (mixer) and visual assets (sprites, background).
* **Core Technology:** Pygame (Graphics & Audio), Math, Python OOP.

### 🚀 Execution and Usage

**1. Requirements:** Python 3.x and the Pygame library: `pip install pygame`
**2. Data Input:** Requires external image and audio files (sprites, background, .mp3, .wav) to be present in the root folder.
**3. Execution:** Run the game directly from the command line:

    ```bash
    python space_invaders.py
    ```
